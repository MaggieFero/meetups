## The Jobs that Meetup Organizers Do

These are the roles that have to be filled for every meetup. You're allowed to fill more than one role for the same meetup (it's not mandatory, but nobody will stop you if you want to do more).


### Planning tasks

* Coordinator - Plans an event by finding a topic and speaker
* Sponsor wrangler - finds corporate sponsors to provide a venue, or food, or both
* Social media manager - promotes events by multiple platforms and builds an audience for the twitter account by posting between meetups

### Event-specific tasks

* The emcee - Opens and closes the meeting, makes WTD-related announcements, acknowledges sponsors and introduces the speaker
* Greeters - Speak to every attendee to make sure they feel welcomed, that they find name badges and refreshments, that they get any questions answered and, hopefully, that they decide to keep attending if they're new
* Utility players - Sometimes people have to be guided to the event from the front door of the building, or there is furniture to move, or put back, or cleaning up after the event
* Technology wranglers - Often someone is needed to handle audio and video equipment or manage a webex
