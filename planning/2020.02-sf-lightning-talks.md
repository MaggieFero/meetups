ANNOUNCEMENT

Happy New Year! We hope you had a wonderful winter break and look forward to bringing enriching sessions to you in 2019. It’s time for some action!

Let’s start the first WTD-SF meetup of the New Year with an Open Mic Night! The Write the Docs SF Meetup wants YOU to give a Lightning Talk at the February 26 meetup at Braintree.

LIGHTNING TALKS

Lightning talks are short presentations no more than 5 minutes long. You can speak with or without slides -- it’s your choice. Here are some suggestions:

● Share something you are currently working on
● Get feedback on a challenge you’re facing
● Talk about a tool or process you’re using
● Polish your presentation skills

• Lightning talks are short presentations no more than five minutes long.

• Ideally a lightning talk focuses on one concept in a quick and clear manner. It could be a favorite bit of writing advice, an authoring tool tip, a UX messaging concept, a tidbit of Agile for docs methodology that you live by...or any one of a thousand other things. What's on your mind this week?

• The subject should be relevant to the WTD audience. Keep in mind, however, that you can be as serious or as silly as you like.

• You can use slides, but you'll probably want 15 or fewer unless you plan to click through them quickly (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha).

• If you're not used to public speaking, keep two things in mind:

a) the audience is on your side and wants you to succeed and

b) five minutes goes by FAST.

At conferences, lightning talks are the second most popular presentation type, after the keynote presentation. They're a favorite because in addition to hearing many speakers in a single time slot, the audience learns many facts in a short time.

For more tips about creating lightning talks, see:

• Barrie Byron's "So you want to give a lightning talk. (https://barriebyron.wordpress.com/2013/02/17/so-you-want-to-give-a-lightning-talk/)"

• A talk for Android game developers called "The Top Three Game Design Mistakes You're Making (https://youtu.be/THn4f6zAuJ4)." Notice the usage of images over text in the slides.
